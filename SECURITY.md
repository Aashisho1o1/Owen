# Security Policy for Owen AI

## Our Commitment

At Owen AI, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. We are committed to protecting our users' data and providing a secure writing environment. However, no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

This policy outlines how we handle security reports and what we expect from the security community.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate it if you would help us by disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We encourage you to report any potential security issues to our private security email address: **security@owen-ai.com** (Note: This is a placeholder address for now).

**Please include the following information in your report:**

*   A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that can help us understand the issue.

We will make every effort to respond to your report within 48 hours. We will also keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and resolve the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To protect our users, we request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. We will work with you to agree on a timeline for public disclosure.

We also ask that you act in good faith and avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research.

## Bounties / Recognition

While we do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, we would like to express our gratitude to security researchers who report vulnerabilities to us. We will happily provide a public acknowledgment and thank you for your contribution on our website and in our release notes once the vulnerability has been resolved.
